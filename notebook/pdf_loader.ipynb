The  plan  is  divided  into  monthly  phases  with  clear  goals,  hands-on\\nprojects,  and  curated  resources.  To  minimize  dropout  risk,  we  emphasize  project-based  learning and\\nspaced repetition (regularly revisiting past concepts) to reinforce knowledge. By the end, Yash will have a\\nstrong portfolio (GitHub projects and YouTube content on his channel “Engimemer”) demonstrating skills in\\nbuilding agent-based AI applications (AutoGPT-like systems) and the confidence to pursue FAANG-level\\nroles or AI freelancing.\\nMonth 1: Foundations – Python Mastery & Math Refresher\\nFocus: Build a strong foundation in programming and mathematics for AI.\\nKey Learning Goals: Solidify intermediate Python skills and refresh essential math for ML.\\nSpecifically, master Python language constructs (functions, OOP) and data handling libraries, and\\nreview linear algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues), basic calculus (derivatives, gradients), and\\nprobability/statistics (mean, variance, Bayes’ theorem). \\nCore Concepts & Tools: Python best practices (writing clean, efficient code); using Jupyter/VS Code\\nand Google Colab for experiments; NumPy for matrix operations, Pandas for data manipulation,\\nMatplotlib/Seaborn for plotting. Math concepts like matrix multiplication, differentiation (for\\ngradient descent), and statistical thinking for data analysis. \\nBest Resources:\\nPython: “Automate the Boring Stuff” (for practice scripts) and Real Python tutorials on OOP . \\nMath: Khan Academy or Mathematics for Machine Learning (online book) for linear algebra &\\ncalculus refresh. \\nStatQuest (YouTube) – excellent simple videos on stats and linear algebra concepts (e.g. StatQuest’s\\nlinear regression, PCA videos). \\nfast.ai’s optional math review sections or Gilbert Strang’s MIT lectures for linear algebra (if deeper\\ndive needed). \\nProjects & Portfolio:\\nCode a simple linear regression from scratch (no ML libraries) to predict a small dataset (e.g.\\nhouse prices). This solidifies math-programming synergy. Visualize the fit line and error\\nconvergence. Publish this on GitHub. \\nYouTube Opportunity: Create a vlog-style video explaining how linear regression works and walking\\nthrough your implementation. This helps cement your understanding and kicks off your Engimemer\\nchannel content. \\nSpaced Repetition: Start making flashcards or notes for key formulas (e.g. matrix operations,\\nderivative rules).

Learn core algorithms in supervised learning (regression,\\nclassification) and unsupervised learning. Key topics include train/test splits, overfitting vs.\\ngeneralization, and performance metrics. \\nCore Concepts & Tools: Supervised vs. unsupervised learning; algorithms like linear & logistic\\nregression, decision trees, k-NN, SVMs for basics; clustering (k-means, DBSCAN) for\\nunsupervised. Tools: scikit-learn (implementing algorithms and pipeline), pandas for data cleaning,\\nand matplotlib for result visualization. Also introduce version control (Git/GitHub) to manage code. \\nBest Resources:\\nAndrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization (Coursera) – covers regression, classification,\\nclustering, etc., providing a solid theoretical grounding. \\nHands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow (Aurélien Géron) – a practical book\\nto reference implementations and tips. \\nStatQuest – continue using videos for intuitions on algorithms (e.g. StatQuest’s decision tree and\\nPCA videos). \\nscikit-learn docs & tutorials – to learn API usage for training models and evaluating them. \\nProjects & Portfolio:\\nEnd-to-End ML Project: Pick a simple dataset (e.g. Titanic survival or California housing prices).\\nPerform data cleaning, exploratory analysis (visualize key patterns), then train a model (e.g. logistic\\nregression or decision tree). Evaluate with appropriate metrics (accuracy for classification or RMSE\\nfor regression). Finally, deploy this as a simple app – e.g., a Streamlit or Gradio web app where a\\nuser can input features and get a prediction. This exposes you to the full lifecycle. \\nOptionally, tackle a second project focusing on unsupervised learning (e.g. use k-means to cluster a\\ndataset and visualize results) to appreciate different ML paradigms. \\nYouTube Opportunity: Create a tutorial video “How I built my first ML model to predict Titanic\\nsurvivors” – show data exploration, model intuition, and a live demo of your app. This not only builds\\nyour portfolio but also reinforces your understanding by teaching it. \\nSpaced Repetition: Continue weekly reviews of last month’s math (e.g., quiz yourself on what\\noverfitting means or the formula for linear regression).

Fast.ai’s course is very hands-on\\nand emphasizes experimentation first, aligning well with our project-based philosophy (Hugging\\nFace even recommends doing an intro DL course like fast.ai or DeepLearning.AI before advanced\\ntopics). \\nAndrej Karpathy’s “Neural Networks: Zero to Hero” (YouTube) – Karpathy builds neural nets and\\na mini-GPT from scratch in code. The early videos (micrograd, makemore series) are excellent to see\\nbackpropagation and training loop coded line-by-line. This can deeply solidify your\\nunderstanding of how everything works under the hood. \\nPyTorch official tutorials – to learn the basics of tensor operations and autograd, once you grasp\\nthe manual concepts. \\nProjects & Portfolio:\\nNeural Net from Scratch: Implement a simple multilayer perceptron using only NumPy (no high-\\nlevel library) to classify a small dataset (e.g. classify handwritten digits 0–9 from the MNIST dataset).\\nThis means coding the forward pass and backpropagation manually. It’s challenging, but doing this\\nfor even a small network (e.g. one hidden layer) will cement your understanding of how gradients\\nflow. \\nDeep Learning Project: Using a framework (PyTorch/Keras), train a feed-forward neural network on\\nMNIST or a similar dataset. Aim for good accuracy on validation data. This lets you focus on\\nusing library components (layers, loss functions, optimizers) now that you understand what they do.\\nSave this project to GitHub, including instructions to run it on Colab (since you may not have a local\\nGPU). \\nYouTube Opportunity: Create a video titled “I built a neural network from scratch in Python” –\\nexplain the concept of backpropagation in simple terms and demo your NumPy network learning to\\nrecognize digits. This not only advertises your skill but also helps you review the concept by teaching\\nit. \\nSpaced Repetition: This month introduces many new concepts – make flashcards for definitions\\n(e.g. “What is an activation function? Give examples.” or “What does the derivative of ReLU look\\nlike?”). Revisit your math cards from prior months to keep the fundamentals fresh, since deep\\nlearning heavily uses them (e.g., understanding gradients).\\nMonth 4: Deep Learning Expanded – Computer Vision and/or NLP\\nBasics\\nFocus: Broaden your deep learning skills to new data types.

Given the end-goal of agentic AI (which leans toward NLP/LLMs), prioritize NLP if\\nneeded, but a taste of CV will make you well-rounded.\\nKey Learning Goals (CV): Understand Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image data –\\nconvolution/pooling operations, architectures like LeNet/ResNet, and why CNNs excel in vision tasks\\n. Learn about using pretrained models and transfer learning (e.g. using a pretrained ResNet on a\\nnew small image dataset). \\nKey Learning Goals (NLP): Understand basics of text representation – text preprocessing\\n(tokenization, embeddings like word2vec), and how sequence models work. Recurrent Neural\\nNetworks (RNNs) and LSTMs were traditional approaches; understand their role and limitations (e.g.\\nvanishing gradients in long sequences). Introduce the concept of the Transformer architecture,\\nwhich overcomes those limitations and forms the backbone of modern LLMs. By the end, you\\nshould grasp why transformers replaced RNNs for NLP , even if you don’t deeply train an RNN. \\nCore Concepts & Tools:\\nCV: Convolutions, filters/kernels, feature maps, common CNN layers. Tools: PyTorch/TensorFlow\\nwith CNN modules (e.g. torchvision for datasets and pretrained models). Possibly experiment\\nwith OpenCV for basic image processing to augment understanding. \\nNLP: Text cleaning (stopwords, stemming – though less needed with modern models), word\\nembeddings (learn what they are conceptually), sequence modeling. Tools: experiment with a simple\\nRNN using Keras or PyTorch’s nn.LSTM. Also introduce Hugging Face Transformers library at a\\nhigh level – for example, try using a pre-trained BERT or GPT-2 model for a simple task to see the\\ntransformer in action (more on this next month). \\nBest Resources:\\nDeepLearning.AI’s courses on CNNs and Sequence Models (Andrew Ng) – these provide a solid\\nbase in each domain (CNN course covers ConvNet architectures, Sequence course covers RNN,\\nLSTM, and an intro to attention mechanism). If pressed for time, focus on sequence models because\\nLLMs/Agentic AI will build on that. \\nfast.ai Course (if following) – fast.ai’s early lessons cover CNNs for image classification in a very\\nhands-on way (you build an image classifier in Lesson 1 itself with transfer learning). This is\\nmotivating and teaches practical tips. They also cover an NLP segment where you fine-tune an AWD-\\nLSTM on text – insightful even if LSTMs are now older , because it teaches how to handle text data. \\nStanford CS231n (for CV) – lecture videos or notes (if you want deeper theoretical knowledge of\\nCNNs and vision tasks). \\nStanford CS224n (for NLP) – lectures on NLP and transformers by leading researchers (good to\\ndeepen theory behind attention and transformers). \\nYouTube: 3Blue1Brown’s video “But what is a convolution?” (for an intuitive visualization), and\\nStatQuest’s “RNNs and LSTMs” for simple explanations of these concepts. \\nProjects & Portfolio:\\nComputer Vision Project: Build and deploy a simple image classifier. For example, collect or use a\\ndataset of, say, plant diseases or traffic signs (something small). Train a CNN to categorize images. If\\nusing a small dataset, apply transfer learning with a pretrained model (e.g., fine-tune ResNet on your\\ndataset) – a valuable real-world skill. Aim to achieve decent accuracy, and deploy this model as a web\\ndemo (perhaps on Hugging Face Spaces or a simple Flask app). This demonstrates the ability to\\napply deep learning to real data. \\nNLP Project: Build a text classifier or chatbot. For instance, create a sentiment analysis model for\\nmovie reviews. You could fine-tune a pre-trained transformer (like DistilBERT) on a movie reviews\\ndataset to classify sentiment. This will expose you to the Hugging Face ecosystem and transformer\\n• \\n10\\n• \\n11\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n4'),\n",

(If computing resources are an issue, use Google Colab with free GPU for\\ntraining, or choose a smaller model and smaller dataset to fine-tune.) By now, you may start\\nChapter 1–4 of Hugging Face’s free Transformers course, which walks through using pre-trained\\nmodels and fine-tuning – it’s a great guided project that will result in a model you can share on\\nHugging Face Hub. \\nYouTube Opportunity: For the CV project, make a video like “Building an AI that recognizes plant\\ndiseases” – show how you collected data and how the CNN performs (people love visual demos). For\\nthe NLP project, consider a video titled “Fine-tuning my first Transformer model” – explain in simple\\nterms what BERT is doing and show your model in action. These not only market your skills but also\\nforce you to articulate complex concepts clearly. \\nSpaced Repetition: This is a content-heavy month. Leverage spaced repetition by frequently\\nrevisiting earlier lessons – e.g., when learning transformers, recall how an RNN works and how a\\nCNN works; this comparative thinking reinforces memory. Quiz yourself: “Why might an LSTM be\\ninsufficient for long text?” or “What does a convolution filter do?”. Also keep using your Anki/flashcards\\nfor math and DL basics (the cumulative knowledge will soon be applied in building LLM-based\\nagents).\\nMonth 5: Mastering Transformers – Hugging Face and LLMs\\nFocus: Deep dive into transformers and large language models (LLMs), and become proficient with the\\nHugging  Face  ecosystem  for  NLP .  This  month  transitions  from  traditional  ML/DL  into  the  realm  of\\ngenerative AI and LLMs, which is core for agentic AI. \\nKey Learning Goals: Gain a solid understanding of how Transformer architectures work (self-\\nattention mechanism, encoder-decoder vs decoder-only models), and how modern LLMs (GPT, BERT,\\netc.) are built on these principles. Learn to use pre-trained LLMs from Hugging Face for various tasks\\nand fine-tune them on custom data. By the end of the month, you should comfortably load a model\\nfrom Hugging Face Hub, use it for inference (text generation, classification, etc.), and know the\\nworkflow for fine-tuning a model on a new dataset. \\nCore Concepts & Tools: Transformers theory (multi-head attention, positional embeddings, etc.),\\ndifferences between model types (e.g. BERT is an encoder-only transformer good for understanding\\ntasks, GPT-3 is decoder-only, etc.), the concept of transfer learning in NLP (pretrain on large corpus,\\nfine-tune on task). Tools: Hugging Face Transformers library (APIs like AutoModel, \\nAutoTokenizer), Hugging Face Datasets (to load common NLP datasets easily), and using \\nHugging Face Hub to find and use community models. If resources allow, familiarize with Google\\nColab Pro or Kaggle Kernels for longer training jobs. Also, practice using Git and GitHub more as\\nyou handle larger code/projects – this is part of being production-ready. \\nBest Resources:\\nThe Hugging Face Course (Transformers) – complete this course this month. It’s free and covers\\nusing Transformers, fine-tuning, and even deploying models. Chapters 1-8 will teach you how to\\nload models, tokenize data, fine-tune on a dataset, and share your model. (Chapters 9+ go into\\nbuilding demos and advanced topics – which you will find useful for sharing your work and for next\\nmonth’s advanced LLM techniques.) This course is highly recommended as it’s hands-on and up-to-\\ndate with the latest Hugging Face tools, which are industry-standard. \\nAnnotated Transformer (blog or video by Harvard NLP) – for an in-depth look at the original\\nTransformer model “Attention is All You Need”.

It’s a fantastic way to see how pieces of a transformer\\n(tokenization, self-attention, etc.) come together in code. This can be dense, but it connects theory to\\nimplementation. \\nYouTube & Blogs: Look up “Transformers from scratch” by Jay Alammar (famous visual illustrations\\nof how transformer attention works) and Simplilearn or StatQuest summaries on transformers for\\nintuitive explanations. Also consider the Hugging Face YouTube channel – they often have videos\\nfor beginners on using their library. \\nProjects & Portfolio:\\nFine-tune an LLM: Choose a task and fine-tune a pre-trained transformer on it. For example, create\\na Question-Answering system on a niche dataset: use Hugging Face to fine-tune a smaller model\\n(like DistilBERT or RoBERTa) on a QA dataset (SQuAD or a custom set of Q&A pairs you prepare). This\\nteaches you the end-to-end of customizing an LLM. After fine-tuning, evaluate it and upload your\\nmodel to Hugging Face Hub (so others can see/use it, and you can reference it on your resume). \\nHugging Face’s course actually guides you through such a project, so follow that closely. \\nBuild a Language Generation Demo: Using an open-source language model (like GPT-2 or\\nEleutherAI’s GPT-Neo), build a fun demo – e.g., a text generator that completes a sentence or writes\\nshort stories on prompts. You can do this without fine-tuning (just use the pre-trained model with a\\nprompt) or fine-tune it on a specific style (say Shakespearean text) if resources permit. Host this as a\\nHugging Face Space (they support Gradio apps for free) so you have a live demo in your portfolio\\n. \\nYouTube Opportunity: Publish a video titled “Fine-tuning a Transformer model (Hugging Face\\nCourse Review)” – share your screen as you walk through the fine-tuning process you did, explaining\\neach step (loading data, training, evaluating). For the generation demo, you could do a creative piece\\nlike “I taught a GPT-2 to write Shakespeare – here’s how!”. These make for engaging content and\\ndemonstrate your practical skills with LLMs. \\nSpaced Repetition: Now that you’re dealing with a lot of new info, use spaced repetition for\\nterminology (e.g., “What is self-attention?”, “What does CLS token mean in BERT?”). Revisit your older\\nflashcards on ML basics – bridging old and new (e.g. compare how a transformer vs a simple neural\\nnet handles inputs). Also, consider writing a weekly summary of what you learned in a short blog or\\njournal – rephrasing concepts in your own words is a great review technique and can be content for\\nLinkedIn or Medium.\\nMonth 6: Projects & Portfolio Expansion – Applying What You’ve\\nLearned\\nFocus: Consolidate your knowledge by building multiple  portfolio-worthy projects. This month is about\\nlearning by doing – picking projects that integrate the skills from the first half of the year and pushing\\nthem a bit further . By now, you have a range of skills: classical ML, deep learning, and basic LLM usage. It’s\\ntime to showcase them and fill any small gaps in knowledge through practice. \\nKey Learning Goals: Gain confidence in independently scoping and executing AI projects end-to-\\nend. Solidify understanding of the entire workflow: problem formulation, data collection, model\\nselection, training, testing, and deployment. Also, learn how to present your projects (readme\\ndocumentation, clean code, brief reports) because employers and freelance clients value clarity. In\\naddition, start exploring Kaggle competitions or AI hackathons to experience real-world problem\\nsolving under constraints, which builds both skill and resume. \\n• \\n13\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n12\\n• \\n14\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n6\"),\n",

Also, review how top Kaggle kernels\\nare written – you’ll learn a lot about clean coding and analysis from them. \\nFull-Stack Deep Learning (fullstackdeeplearning.com) – a course/material that covers the practical\\naspects of ML projects (like setting up proper experiments, managing data, etc.). Skim relevant\\nsections to get ideas on best practices. \\nCoursera: “AI for Everyone” or “Data Engineering” – not mandatory, but if you feel weak on the\\n“data” side, a quick course or YouTube series on data pipelines, or one on software engineering for\\nML (Google has a free course on ML engineering professionalism) could be beneficial. \\nKaggle’s micro-courses (free) on topics like data cleaning, ML explainability, etc., to fill minor skill\\ngaps while doing projects. \\nProjects & Portfolio:(Aim to complete 2 projects this month, which can be smaller in scope since you’ll\\njuggle multiple.)\\nProject 1 – NLP or CV Application: Build a practical tool, for example an “AI Resume Reviewer.”\\nThis could use NLP to parse a resume and give feedback. Concretely: use a spaCy or transformer\\nmodel to extract entities (skills, experience), then some rules/ML model to score or suggest\\nimprovements. This project ties NLP with a real-world use-case and is appealing in a portfolio.\\nAlternatively, build a vision-based tool, e.g., an app that can take a picture of a circuit board and\\nidentify components (leveraging your ECE background) using a trained CNN. Focus on deployability:\\npackage it with a simple UI. \\nProject 2 – Open-Ended Creative Project*: Pick something that excites you – maybe a *generative\\nart or music project using AI, or a chatbot that uses multiple skills (sentiment analysis + response\\ngeneration). The goal is to have fun and be creative, which keeps motivation high. For instance,\\ncreate a chatbot for a specific domain (like a math tutor bot): it might use an LLM for the\\nconversation, but also incorporate a Python-based calculator tool for solving equations (this idea\\nforeshadows agentic AI with tool use). \\nProject 3 (Optional, Hackathon/Kaggle): Participate in a Kaggle competition or an online AI\\nhackathon this month. This will force you to apply your skills under time pressure and teamwork if\\nit’s a team hackathon. Websites like Lablab.ai regularly host GenAI hackathons – joining one\\nfocused on LLMs or agents can give you a taste of building agentic AI in a sprint. Even if you don’t\\nwin, the experience is invaluable and can be mentioned on your resume (“Participated in XYZ\\nHackathon, built a prototype that does …”). \\nPolish & Presentation: For each project, invest time in making it public-ready: a clean GitHub repo\\nwith a good README (describe the problem, solution, and how to run the code). If possible, deploy\\nthe project (web demo or at least screenshots) and include those in the repo or your portfolio\\nwebsite (if you have one). This will strengthen your profile significantly. \\nYouTube Opportunity: Each project can yield content. For Project 1, you could do a walkthrough\\ntitled “I built an AI Resume Reviewer – Here’s how it works”. For the creative project, maybe a more\\nfun video, “Tour of my AI chatbot that can do math homework!”. Also, consider making a vlog about\\nyour hackathon or Kaggle experience – sharing the approach you took, the mistakes, and lessons\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n15\\n• \\n16\\n• \\n7'),\n",

Regular uploads will\\nsteadily grow your Engimemer channel and also keep you reflecting on your learning. \\nSpaced Repetition: At this midpoint, review everything learned so far in a structured way. Spend a\\nday each week summarizing earlier material: re-derive the formula for backprop, sketch the\\ntransformer architecture from memory, etc. You might even create a “cheat sheet” of key AI concepts\\nlearned in 6 months. This not only helps retention but will be useful in interviews later . Continue\\nusing Anki or your flashcards for any new terms or formulas encountered in projects.\\n(By the end of Month 6, you should have 3-4 solid projects in your portfolio, showcasing different skills – exactly\\nwhat many AI recruiters look for. You’ve also built consistency in learning and doing, which will serve you\\nwell in the next, more specialized phase.)\\nMonth 7: Specialization – Introduction to Agentic AI (LangChain &\\nPrompt Engineering)\\nFocus: Enter the world of Agentic AI by learning how LLMs can be used as agents (software programs that\\nperceive, reason, and act). This month, you will learn prompt engineering in depth and start working with\\nframeworks like LangChain that simplify building AI agents. The goal is to understand how to make LLMs\\ndo things – e.g. perform a series of tasks or use external tools – which is the essence of AutoGPT-like\\nsystems.\\nKey Learning Goals: Develop prompt engineering expertise – crafting effective prompts to get\\nreliable outputs from LLMs, and using techniques like few-shot prompting. Understand the concept\\nof an AI agent: an LLM that can take actions (like calling tools or APIs) autonomously based on\\ninstructions. Learn what architectures like AutoGPT or BabyAGI are doing under the hood\\n(planning, tool use, memory) so you can build simpler versions. By end of month, you should be able\\nto create a basic agent that, given a goal, decides on steps and uses some tools to execute them. \\nCore Concepts & Tools: Prompt design principles (clarity, context, constraints). Advanced prompting\\nmethods: e.g., chain-of-thought prompting (getting the LLM to reason step by step) and few-shot\\nexamples to guide style/format. Understand prompt tokens and costs (to be cost-efficient). Tools: \\nOpenAI API (or another LLM API) – practice sending prompts and parsing outputs in code. \\nLangChain – a powerful framework for chaining LLM calls and integrating tools and memory. Learn\\nLangChain’s basics: what are “chains”, what are “agents”, how to use its components (it provides\\nabstractions for doing retrieval, using tools, maintaining conversation memory, etc.). Also introduce \\nvector databases conceptually here if you haven’t already (LangChain uses vector DBs for long-term\\nmemory and retrieval of facts). We will dive deeper into vector DB next month, but start thinking in\\nthat direction. \\nBest Resources:\\n“ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers” (DeepLearning.AI short course) – this is a free 1.5-\\nhour course by OpenAI’s Isa Fulford and Andrew Ng that teaches prompt engineering best practices\\nand how to use LLM APIs. It’s concise and extremely relevant, covering how to structure\\nprompts, use temperature, etc., and even how to build a custom chatbot using an API. Go through\\nthis course early in the month – it will level up your prompting skills quickly with real examples. \\nLangChain for LLM Application Development (DeepLearning.AI short course) – another short\\ncourse, taught by LangChain’s creator Harrison Chase. In ~1.5 hours it covers LangChain’s core\\nconcepts: models, prompts, parsers, memory, chains, and agents.

Take this after the prompt engineering course; it will tie together\\nprompt skills with a framework to build things. \\nLangChain Documentation & Tutorials – LangChain’s official docs have a tutorial “Build an Agent”\\nthat shows how to create an agent that can use a search tool. Follow this step-by-step to build\\nyour first agent. They also explain various types of agents and tools integration – extremely useful\\nreading. \\nOpenAI Cookbook & Examples – OpenAI’s cookbook (on GitHub) has a section on using models\\nwith function calling (letting GPT-4 use tools) and other prompt tactics. Skim these recipes to learn\\npractical tips (e.g. how to format a prompt for a JSON output, etc.). \\nAnthropic’s “Building Effective Agents” guide – a blog post by Anthropic that discusses best\\npractices for AI agents (like when to use agents vs simple chains, how to handle tool use). It’s a great\\nread to develop an intuition for agent design choices, and many working AI engineers refer to it\\n. \\nCommunities: Join the r/AI_Agents subreddit and the LangChain community (Discord or forums).\\nSince agentic AI is so new, a lot of knowledge is shared in real-time on forums. Seeing others’\\nexperiments or issues will teach you a lot and keep you updated. \\nProjects & Portfolio:\\nPrompt Engineering Mini-Project: Design a complex prompt that turns GPT-4 (or another LLM) into\\nsomething useful, without coding an agent. For example, a prompt that makes the LLM a helpful \\ntravel planner (“You are a travel agent AI...”). Refine it to handle tricky inputs. This exercise in\\niterative prompt crafting will teach you how small wording changes impact outputs. Document your\\nfinal prompt and some chat transcripts as a portfolio piece (it shows your ability to coax functionality\\nfrom an API, which is a valuable skill on its own). \\nBuild Your First AI Agent: Using LangChain, create a simple agent that can perform a task using\\ntools. For instance, “Research Assistant Agent”: it takes a query, uses a web search tool (LangChain\\nhas search integrations) and then summarizes an answer . This involves the agent deciding to call the\\nsearch tool, then perhaps a calculator or wiki API, etc. Another idea: an “Email Assistant Agent”\\nthat reads your emails (you can feed it sample emails), and drafts replies using an LLM, possibly\\nusing a calendar API as a tool to check your availability when scheduling meetings. Keep the scope\\nnarrow so it’s achievable – e.g. one that uses 2 tools maximum. The goal is to get hands-on\\nexperience with the agent loop (LLM observes -> decides action -> tool -> new input -> LLM\\ncontinues...). You will encounter challenges like ensuring the agent doesn’t get stuck or making\\noutput formatted, which are great learning opportunities. \\nVectorstore Experiment (mini): Set up a simple vector database (could be as easy as using FAISS in\\nmemory) with a small custom text dataset (maybe a compilation of your own notes or a few articles).\\nHook it up with LangChain’s retrieval API to create a knowledge base. This isn’t a full project by\\nitself, but a tech demo: e.g., ask questions and have the system retrieve relevant info and feed it to\\nthe LLM (classic RAG pipeline). This will prepare you for next month where we do this more fully. \\nYouTube Opportunity: Share what you learn about prompt engineering – e.g., “5 Prompt Engineering\\nTricks I Learned” with examples (this can attract a lot of viewers given interest in ChatGPT tips). For\\nthe agent, do a live demo video: “Building my first AI agent with LangChain!” – show the agent in action\\n(maybe split-screen with code and it executing tasks). Even if it’s a simple research bot, viewers find\\nthe concept exciting, and it demonstrates cutting-edge skills. You could also reflect on failures or\\niterations, which shows your problem-solving process. \\nSpaced Repetition: As you venture into new territory, relate back to fundamentals. For example,\\nrecall how transformers and embeddings work (important for vector databases and prompt\\nembeddings), or how the ML pipeline works (when thinking about feeding info to LLMs). Revise\\nprevious notes on evaluation metrics – now you should think: How do I evaluate if my agent is “working\\n• \\n19\\n• \\n• \\n23\\n24\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n25\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n9'),\n",

Also, get comfortable with\\nvarious LLM APIs/platforms (not just one) to increase your versatility. By the end of this month, you will\\nhave built an AI application that  combines an LLM with external knowledge, a critical capability for\\nagentic systems.\\nKey Learning Goals: Understand how to handle large knowledge with LLMs – since LLMs have\\ncontext length limits, we use embeddings + vector stores to give them relevant info on the fly.\\nMaster the workflow of creating embeddings for data, storing and querying a vector database. Learn\\nabout popular vector DB solutions (FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.) and trade-offs (memory vs\\nspeed, local vs cloud service). Additionally, explore memory management in agent frameworks\\n(keeping conversation history, summarizing to compress memory, etc.). By now, you should also\\ndeepen your knowledge of various LLM providers – experiment with a new model or API (e.g.,\\nCohere, Anthropic Claude, open-source LLaMA2) to broaden your toolset. \\nCore Concepts & Tools: Embeddings (how text is converted to high-dimensional vectors, e.g. using\\nOpenAI’s text-embedding-ada model or Sentence Transformers). Vector database operations: insert,\\nsimilarity search. LangChain’s RetrievalQA chain or similar: feeding retrieved docs to LLM. Memory\\nin LangChain: short-term (conversation buffers) vs long-term (using a vector store as memory)\\n. Tools: Pick a vector DB – for learning, FAISS (an open-source library) is straightforward to use\\nlocally. You might also try Pinecone or ChromaDB for a managed solution (they have free tiers).\\nContinue with LangChain to integrate these pieces seamlessly. Also consider using Hugging Face\\nHub for embeddings/models if you want to try non-OpenAI models. If you haven’t yet, using a local\\nLLM (like Llama-2 13B on a Colab or smaller model on CPU) could be educational to see how to\\ndeploy models without an API – though this is optional if resources are limited. \\nBest Resources:\\nHugging Face Course, Chapter on “Build Reasoning Agents” – the later chapters of the HF course\\n(Ch. 11-12) cover fine-tuning LLMs and building reasoning models. These might touch on retrieval\\nand advanced use-cases – worth reading for a structured insight. \\nBlogs on RAG: “How to build a QA system with RAG” – many blog posts or Medium articles exist (e.g.\\nby AWS, Cohere, or independent bloggers) that walk through building a document Q&A bot with\\nLangChain + vector DB. Follow one of these tutorials to reinforce your understanding. \\nDeepLearning.AI short course: “Building and Evaluating Advanced RAG Applications” – (as\\nhinted in their site) if available, this could be very relevant. If not, seek out conference talks or\\nwebinars on RAG. For instance, Pinecone’s blog has articles on designing good RAG systems\\n(covering chunking strategies, etc.). \\nDocumentation: Read Pinecone’s docs or FAISS wiki to understand how vector search works under\\nthe hood (helps if you need to optimize or debug retrieval issues). Also, the LangChain docs on\\nMemory and on VectorStores are crucial – they provide code snippets and explain different types of\\nmemory (short-term vs long-term). \\n• \\n• \\n26\\n27\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n28 29\\n10'),\n",

But even a single-step QA with retrieval is a huge accomplishment. \\nTest the system on various queries, refine chunk sizes or prompt as needed for better\\nanswers.\\nThis project solidifies many skills and is highly relevant to real-world applications (companies\\nlove this use-case). Make sure to log how well it answers questions (you can demonstrate it\\nanswering things that vanilla ChatGPT cannot because it has your custom data). \\nExperiment with Multi-LLM or Tools: As part of above or separate small experiment, try using a\\ndifferent model for embedding vs answering. For instance, use OpenAI’s API for answers but a local\\nmodel for embeddings, or vice versa. Or incorporate a new tool into your agent: e.g., a calculator or\\nPython REPL for math problems. This will teach you how to mix and match components for efficiency\\n(an important production consideration is cost and latency – e.g., using a smaller model when\\nappropriate). \\nIntermediate Deliverable: By end of this month, have a working Q&A system (even if not fully an\\nautonomous “agent”), which accepts user queries about your documents and returns answers with\\nreferences. This sets the stage for next month, where you can extend it into more of an “agent” with\\nplanning abilities. \\nYouTube Opportunity: Document this capstone’s development.

Building on the “AI Research Assistant” (or whichever\\nRAG system you made), add a planning and tool-use layer. For example, enable the agent to\\nhandle a complex query like: “Summarize the key differences between these two research papers\\nand email the summary to my colleague.” This would require the agent to break it down: (a) search\\nor retrieve info on paper 1 and 2, (b) summarize differences, (c) formulate an email, (d) possibly\\nactually send an email via an email API (if you choose to integrate that tool). This is just an example –\\ndefine a scenario relevant to your interests. The agent should use multiple steps autonomously:\\nretrieving data, using a writing tool, maybe a calculation or API call, etc., without you intervening in\\neach step. Document the chain of thought: have the agent output or log its reasoning at each step\\n(this is great for demo and debugging). \\nTesting and Refinement: Once built, test your agent on a variety of tasks within its scope. Observe\\nfailure modes (does it get stuck in a loop? Does it ever hallucinate wrong info from outside the\\ndocs?). Refine by adjusting prompts or adding constraints. For instance, if it tends to hallucinate, you\\nmight enforce that it must quote sources for factual info, or if it loops, add a rule to break after N steps\\nwith a graceful response. This process teaches MLOps mindset – iterate to improve reliability. \\nFinalize Deployment: Deploy your capstone if possible. For instance, create a small web interface\\nfor it (a simple frontend where you input a query and see the agent’s plan and answer). If deploying\\nfully is hard, at least record a compelling demo of it working. Also, prepare a technical write-up in\\nyour GitHub repo or a Medium article about how you built this agent. This can be gold for your\\nportfolio – it demonstrates end-to-end project execution and thought leadership (few people have\\nwritten detailed guides on building agents – you could!). \\nYouTube Opportunity: This is the big one – create a showcase video: “I built my own Auto-GPT in 30\\ndays” or “Autonomous AI Agent demo – [Your Agent’s Name]”. In this video, present the problem it\\nsolves, show it performing a multi-step task live (with its thinking printed out), and explain how you\\nmade it. This is likely to attract attention given the hype around AI agents, and it serves as a\\ncapstone presentation of your skills. Share this video on LinkedIn, Reddit, etc. for feedback and\\nperhaps it catches the eye of recruiters or potential collaborators. \\nSpaced Repetition: At this point, spaced repetition is about interview prep and knowledge\\nsynthesis. Start reviewing topics you may not have touched recently: e.g., revisit how SVMs work or\\nhow backprop works – interviews might dig into fundamentals even if your focus was on LLMs. Use\\nflashcards for data structures and algorithms (you’ll need some for coding interviews at FAANG). Also\\nconsider doing a high-level review of all projects: can you summarize each project’s key idea and\\nlearning in a few sentences from memory? If not, review it. This prepares you to talk about them\\nfluently in interviews. Continue using spaced repetition for new things too (e.g., key lessons you\\nlearned about agent design – write those down and revisit).\\nMonth 10: Production Readiness – MLOps, Deployment, and\\nScalability\\nFocus: Shift gears to learn MLOps and deployment best practices. This month is about making sure you can\\ntake an AI model/agent and deploy it in a production environment reliably. You’ll also prepare for the job\\nhunt by aligning your skills with what industry expects (scalability, reliability, collaboration).\\nKey Learning Goals: Learn how to package and deploy models and AI systems as services.\\nUnderstand the concepts of containerization (Docker), CI/CD, and cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/\\nAzure) as applicable to AI apps.

Security: understand basic\\nmeasures (storing API keys securely, not exposing secrets, etc.). \\nBest Resources:\\nFull Stack Deep Learning – their material on deployment and monitoring is very relevant (they talk\\nabout packaging models and setting up inference endpoints). \\nCoursera or Udacity MLOps courses – if available, doing a crash course on MLOps will systematize\\nthis knowledge. Andrew Ng’s MLOps specialization or Google Cloud’s ML Engineering courses\\ncould be useful. \\nAWS/GCP free tutorials – both AWS and Google have free training for deploying ML models (e.g.,\\nAWS SageMaker tutorials, GCP Vertex AI samples). Even if you don’t use the managed services now,\\nknowing they exist and how they work is good for interviews. \\nDocker Official Docs & DockerCaptain YouTube – to learn writing Dockerfiles and container basics.\\nFastAPI docs – FastAPI is a great tool to wrap your models into web services quickly. Their docs are\\nbeginner-friendly and you can have a simple “Hello World” model API running in minutes. \\n“Building LLM applications for production” by Chip Huyen – this blog (if you haven’t fully read it\\nyet) covers practical challenges in deploying LLM apps (like handling ambiguity in prompts,\\nversioning, evaluation). It’s basically a checklist of things to keep in mind so that your fancy LLM\\ndemo doesn’t break in the real world. Read it and reflect on how you can apply those principles to\\nyour capstone agent if you deployed it. \\nProjects & Portfolio:\\nDeploy Your Capstone Agent: Take the autonomous agent from last month and deploy it as a\\nservice. For example, wrap it in a FastAPI server where one endpoint /ask triggers the agent with\\na user query and returns the answer . Containerize this with Docker . Then try deploying it to a cloud\\nservice or at least run it on a cloud VM to simulate production. This exercise will expose issues\\n(memory usage, need for loading models efficiently, etc.). Ensure you include logging – have the\\nservice log each step of the agent’s reasoning to a file or console for monitoring. If possible, simulate\\na few concurrent users to see how it handles (you might realize the agent is stateful and needs\\nunique sessions or it’s slow – which is normal; note those findings). \\nCI/CD Pipeline: Set up a simple CI pipeline for one of your projects. For instance, use GitHub Actions\\nsuch that when you push to main on your capstone’s repo, it automatically runs tests (if you add any)\\nand maybe deploys to your server . This shows you understand DevOps culture. Document this in\\nyour project readme (“Using GitHub Actions to auto-deploy on update”). It’s a nice touch that many\\ncandidates lack. \\n• \\n30\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n35\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n14'),\n",

For example, find a real problem on Reddit or Freelance boards – e.g., “I need a\\nscript to categorize a bunch of customer feedback using AI.” Then build a quick solution for it: maybe\\nfine-tune a model or use an off-the-shelf model via API, and deliver it as a script or small app. Do it\\nend-to-end in say 3-4 days as if it were a paid gig. This will teach working under requirements and\\nalso give you a template for similar future freelance tasks. You can write about this experience as\\nwell. \\nYouTube/Blog Opportunity: Create content focusing on the production aspect this time – e.g., \\n“How to deploy an AI model as an API (step-by-step)”. This could be a tutorial where you containerize\\nand deploy a smaller ML model (maybe your Month 2 model or a simple Hugging Face model) to a\\nfree service. Many find this educational, and it forces you to articulate the process. Additionally,\\nconsider writing a Medium blog post summarizing your capstone project with a focus on its\\nproduction design (“Building an AutoGPT-style agent and deploying it on AWS”). Writing an article\\ncan increase your visibility in the field (and you can add it to your resume). \\nSpaced Repetition: Now shift some focus to interview preparation content for spaced repetition.\\nFor example, use flashcards to remember key points that you might mention in interviews: big-O\\ncomplexities, definitions of overfitting vs underfitting, the trade-offs of different model types, etc.\\nRevisit any theoretical gaps you feel – e.g., if you skipped some math, review it now. Continue to\\nrevisit high-level summaries of each project and each major concept (by now you have a web of\\nknowledge – solidify the connections: how does an embedding from Month 8 relate to the cosine\\nsimilarity you learned in Month 1 math? How does Docker compare to a virtualenv from earlier\\nprojects? Connecting dots is a great memory tool).\\nMonth 11: Job Hunt Preparation – Polishing Skills and Portfolio\\nFocus: This month is about getting ready to land a job or freelance clients. We will polish your resume,\\nportfolio, and online presence, and prepare for technical interviews (both coding and ML system design).\\nWe’ll also ensure you leverage your YouTube channel and network for opportunities.\\nKey Tasks – Resume & Portfolio: Craft a strong resume that highlights your AI projects and skills.\\nEmphasize outcomes: e.g., “Built an autonomous research assistant agent using LangChain and\\nGPT-4, integrating vector database for 20k documents (GitHub, demo link)”. Quantify where possible\\n(even if just “achieved 90% accuracy on X” or “improved inference speed by Y% with optimization”).\\nInclude keywords like the tools and frameworks you know (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face,\\nLangChain, Docker , etc.) so it passes automated scans. Also update your LinkedIn to reflect your\\nyear of projects – write a summary that you’re an AI engineer specializing in LLMs/agents, open to\\nopportunities. On GitHub, pin your best projects to showcase them. Ensure your project READMEs\\nare clear because recruiters will look at them. If you have a personal portfolio website, update it with\\nlinks to your YouTube videos and project write-ups – make it a one-stop-shop of your expertise. \\nKey Tasks – Networking: Start actively networking. Announce on LinkedIn the completion of your\\nyear-long learning journey, perhaps with a post sharing your Medium article or YouTube capstone\\ndemo. Engage with communities: e.g., on Twitter (X) share insights or small threads about\\nsomething cool you learned about agents (tagging relevant hashtags like #LangChain, #LLM). This\\ncan get you noticed. Also consider reaching out to people in companies you’re interested in – not\\nasking for a job outright, but commenting on their work or asking for advice given your newly\\nminted experience. Join hackathons or meetups (if available locally or virtually) to meet like-minded\\nfolks. Often job leads come from these connections. \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n16\\n• \\n15'),\n",

Even for AI roles, many top\\ncompanies will have a coding round (FAANG especially). Use platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.\\nFocus on problems around arrays, strings, hash maps, graphs, etc. Aim to solve at least one\\nmedium-difficulty problem each day, and periodically do timed mock interviews. Use spaced\\nrepetition to remember common patterns (two-pointer , BFS, DP etc.). Since you can code in Python,\\nleverage that, but be familiar with complexity analysis. \\nInterview Prep – ML & System Design: Prepare to answer questions on ML concepts: e.g., explain\\nhow logistic regression works, what is bias vs variance, how do you handle missing data, etc. Review\\nyour flashcards on all fundamental definitions. Practice explaining your projects out loud – you\\nshould be able to crisply discuss the goal, approach, and results of each. Also practice ML system\\ndesign questions (common in ML engineer interviews): e.g., “How would you design a system to\\nrecommend products?” or “How would you deploy a model that handles 1 million requests/day?” –\\nhere you draw from your Month 10 knowledge (talk about load balancing, caching, monitoring). If\\napplying to specifically LLM-related roles, prepare for questions like “How do you fine-tune an LLM?\\nWhat are the challenges?” or “How would you improve inference latency for an LLM in production?”.\\nDraw on what you learned about quantization or using smaller models for speed. \\nFreelance Prep: In parallel, if freelancing is a goal, create profiles on platforms like Upwork or\\nFreelancer . Showcase your projects there (many clients will be impressed by an AutoGPT-like project).\\nPerhaps start by bidding on a small project that matches your skills to get a feel for the freelance\\nworkflow. Even if you plan to take a full-time job, a little freelancing can provide experience and a\\nside income. Also, your YouTube channel is now a portfolio piece – mention it in your bio (“I also run\\na YouTube channel with tutorials on AI, with X subscribers”). Having an audience can set you apart. \\nBest Resources:\\nCracking the Coding Interview (book) – for coding questions patterns. \\nInterview Query or Machine Learning Interview guides – there are blogs and books that list\\ncommon ML engineer interview Qs. Go through those.\\nLeetCode’s database and system design sections – sometimes AI roles ask SQL or basic system\\ndesign; ensure you can write simple SQL queries and outline system architecture. \\nMock interviews: Try Pramp (free mock interview platform) or interview with a friend/mentor . This\\ncan greatly boost confidence. \\nResume review communities: r/EngineeringResumes on Reddit or others – you can get feedback\\non your resume from peers. \\nProjects (Polish & Present): This month you likely won’t start new technical projects, but you might \\nrevisit an old project to polish it. For example, if one of your earlier projects lacked tests or had\\nsome bugs, fixing those shows growth. You can even do a “v2” of a project using new skills (e.g.,\\nrefactor your Month 2 ML project with proper pipelines or deploy your Month 4 CNN as an API).\\nMinor improvements can be content on your blog (“I revisited my old project with new eyes and\\nhere’s what I improved”). It demonstrates continuous improvement. \\nYouTube Opportunity: Share your journey now that you have nearly completed it. A video like “How\\nI became an AI Engineer in 12 months” where you candidly discuss the roadmap, challenges, and\\nshow snippets of projects could inspire others and also serve as a self-reflection. Additionally, you\\ncould do live streams solving LeetCode problems or talking about interview prep – this shows you’re\\nserious about the job transition and might even attract leads (somebody could refer you after seeing\\nyour depth). \\nSpaced Repetition: This is where your spaced repetition habit pays off – keep cycling through all\\nthose flashcards on theory and math regularly so everything is fresh. Also, simulate Q&A: have a list\\nof likely interview questions (technical and behavioral) and practice responding out loud or in\\nwriting. Use Anki for tricky algorithm tips or specific facts (like “What’s the equation for a neuron\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n16'),\n",

By now, you should also revisit any ECE core knowledge if relevant\\n– sometimes, roles value that background, so don’t neglect what you learned in your degree; be\\nready to mention how it complements your AI skills (e.g., knowledge of hardware could help\\noptimize models, etc.). Keep your mind fresh but also get enough rest – don’t burn out right before\\ninterviews.\\nMonth 12: Transition – Interviews, Contributions, and Next Steps\\nFocus: This final month, you will be actively interviewing (if things go to plan) or at least aggressively\\napplying. Meanwhile, continue sharpening skills by contributing to open-source and staying up-to-date with\\nthe latest in AI (to discuss in interviews). Also, lay the groundwork for lifelong learning, since this year is just\\nthe beginning of a career .\\nJob Applications: By now, you should apply to a range of companies – FAANG (stretch goals, but\\nyour strong portfolio gives you a shot!) as well as top startups especially in the AI tooling/LLM space.\\nMany startups would value your experience with LangChain, vector DBs, etc., as those are hot skills.\\nTailor each application – mention your specific experience relevant to their work. Leverage referrals if\\npossible: use LinkedIn to see if you have connections at these companies; a referral plus your project\\nlinks can get you interviews. For freelance, step up outreach: send proposals highlighting similar\\nwork you’ve done. \\nInterview Rounds: Hopefully, you land interviews. In technical rounds, draw confidently on your\\npreparation. For coding, keep practicing problems daily up to the interview day. In ML design\\nrounds, use a structured approach (clarify requirements, explain your approach clearly – you’ve\\npracticed by explaining on YouTube, so use those skills). In behavioral rounds, tell the story of this\\nself-driven journey – it demonstrates passion, perseverance, and ability to learn fast, all highly\\nvalued. Be ready with examples of projects: e.g., “Tell me about a challenging problem you solved” –\\nyou can cite debugging your agent’s hallucinations or managing without a GPU by optimizing code,\\netc. Emphasize how you independently initiated and completed a complex roadmap – that’s akin to\\nbeing a self-driven employee. \\nOpen-Source Contribution: This is a good time to contribute to an open-source project related to\\nyour specialization (if you haven’t yet). For example, contribute a small fix or documentation update\\nto LangChain or Hugging Face Transformers. It signals to employers that you engage with the\\ncommunity and understand collaborative workflows. It could be as simple as improving an example\\nin LangChain’s docs or fixing a minor bug you encountered. Mention this in interviews (“I even\\ncontributed a bugfix to LangChain that got merged”) – it’s impressive. \\nContinued Learning: The field of AI moves rapidly. Identify a few key sources to stay updated: e.g., \\nDeepLearning.AI’s “The Batch” newsletter for weekly AI news, the r/MachineLearning subreddit\\nfor latest research highlights, and YouTube channels like Yannic Kilcher or Two Minute Papers for\\nresearch summaries. This habit will help you in interviews if asked about recent developments (“Have\\nyou heard about GPT-4’s new vision capabilities?” – you can give an informed opinion). It will also\\nserve you well on the job. \\nFreelance/SaaS angle: If by end of the year you decide to build an AI SaaS product (another stated\\ngoal), you now have the skills. This month, you could draft a business plan for a tool you built. For\\nexample, maybe your capstone agent can be turned into a SaaS for researchers or students.\\nConsider if you want to pursue that: even if you take a job, this could be a side project or a startup\\nattempt. Evaluate the market, get feedback from potential users (this itself could be a learning\\nproject – building the product mindset). \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n17'),\n",

This review contex-\\ntualizes the broader scope of RAG research within the\\nlandscape of LLMs.\\n• We identify and discuss the central technologies integral\\nto the RAG process, specifically focusing on the aspects\\nof “Retrieval”, “Generation” and “Augmentation”, and\\ndelve into their synergies, elucidating how these com-\\nponents intricately collaborate to form a cohesive and\\neffective RAG framework.\\n• We have summarized the current assessment methods of\\nRAG, covering 26 tasks, nearly 50 datasets, outlining\\nthe evaluation objectives and metrics, as well as the\\ncurrent evaluation benchmarks and tools. Additionally,\\nwe anticipate future directions for RAG, emphasizing\\npotential enhancements to tackle current challenges.\\nThe paper unfolds as follows: Section II introduces the\\nmain concept and current paradigms of RAG. The following\\nthree sections explore core components—“Retrieval”, “Gen-\\neration” and “Augmentation”, respectively. Section III focuses\\non optimization methods in retrieval,including indexing, query\\nand embedding optimization. Section IV concentrates on post-\\nretrieval process and LLM fine-tuning in generation. Section V\\nanalyzes the three augmentation processes.

At last, the paper\\nconcludes in Section VIII.\\nII. O VERVIEW OF RAG\\nA typical application of RAG is illustrated in Figure 2.\\nHere, a user poses a question to ChatGPT about a recent,\\nwidely discussed news. Given ChatGPT’s reliance on pre-\\ntraining data, it initially lacks the capacity to provide up-\\ndates on recent developments. RAG bridges this information\\ngap by sourcing and incorporating knowledge from external\\ndatabases. In this case, it gathers relevant news articles related\\nto the user’s query. These articles, combined with the original\\nquestion, form a comprehensive prompt that empowers LLMs\\nto generate a well-informed answer.\\nThe RAG research paradigm is continuously evolving, and\\nwe categorize it into three stages: Naive RAG, Advanced\\nRAG, and Modular RAG, as showed in Figure 3.

A representative instance of the RAG process applied to question answering. It mainly consists of 3 steps. 1) Indexing. Documents are split into chunks,\\nencoded into vectors, and stored in a vector database. 2) Retrieval. Retrieve the Top k chunks most relevant to the question based on semantic similarity. 3)\\nGeneration. Input the original question and the retrieved chunks together into LLM to generate the final answer.\\nwidespread adoption of ChatGPT. The Naive RAG follows\\na traditional process that includes indexing, retrieval, and\\ngeneration, which is also characterized as a “Retrieve-Read”\\nframework [7].\\nIndexing starts with the cleaning and extraction of raw data\\nin diverse formats like PDF, HTML, Word, and Markdown,\\nwhich is then converted into a uniform plain text format. To\\naccommodate the context limitations of language models, text\\nis segmented into smaller, digestible chunks. Chunks are then\\nencoded into vector representations using an embedding model\\nand stored in vector database. This step is crucial for enabling\\nefficient similarity searches in the subsequent retrieval phase.\\nRetrieval. Upon receipt of a user query, the RAG system\\nemploys the same encoding model utilized during the indexing\\nphase to transform the query into a vector representation.\\nIt then computes the similarity scores between the query\\nvector and the vector of chunks within the indexed corpus.\\nThe system prioritizes and retrieves the top K chunks that\\ndemonstrate the greatest similarity to the query. These chunks\\nare subsequently used as the expanded context in prompt.\\nGeneration. The posed query and selected documents are\\nsynthesized into a coherent prompt to which a large language\\nmodel is tasked with formulating a response. The model’s\\napproach to answering may vary depending on task-specific\\ncriteria, allowing it to either draw upon its inherent parametric\\nknowledge or restrict its responses to the information con-\\ntained within the provided documents. In cases of ongoing\\ndialogues, any existing conversational history can be integrated\\ninto the prompt, enabling the model to engage in multi-turn\\ndialogue interactions effectively.\\nHowever, Naive RAG encounters notable drawbacks:\\nRetrieval Challenges . The retrieval phase often struggles\\nwith precision and recall, leading to the selection of misaligned\\nor irrelevant chunks, and the missing of crucial information.\\nGeneration Difficulties. In generating responses, the model\\nmay face the issue of hallucination, where it produces con-\\ntent not supported by the retrieved context. This phase can\\nalso suffer from irrelevance, toxicity, or bias in the outputs,\\ndetracting from the quality and reliability of the responses.\\nAugmentation Hurdles . Integrating retrieved information\\nwith the different task can be challenging, sometimes resulting\\nin disjointed or incoherent outputs. The process may also\\nencounter redundancy when similar information is retrieved\\nfrom multiple sources, leading to repetitive responses. Deter-\\nmining the significance and relevance of various passages and\\nensuring stylistic and tonal consistency add further complexity.\\nFacing complex issues, a single retrieval based on the original\\nquery may not suffice to acquire adequate context information.\\nMoreover, there’s a concern that generation models might\\noverly rely on augmented information, leading to outputs that\\nsimply echo retrieved content without adding insightful or\\nsynthesized information.\\nB. Advanced RAG\\nAdvanced RAG introduces specific improvements to over-\\ncome the limitations of Naive RAG. Focusing on enhancing re-\\ntrieval quality, it employs pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strate-\\ngies. To tackle the indexing issues, Advanced RAG refines\\nits indexing techniques through the use of a sliding window\\napproach, fine-grained segmentation, and the incorporation of\\nmetadata.

Comparison between the three paradigms of RAG. (Left) Naive RAG mainly consists of three parts: indexing, retrieval and generation. (Middle)\\nAdvanced RAG proposes multiple optimization strategies around pre-retrieval and post-retrieval, with a process similar to the Naive RAG, still following a\\nchain-like structure. (Right) Modular RAG inherits and develops from the previous paradigm, showcasing greater flexibility overall. This is evident in the\\nintroduction of multiple specific functional modules and the replacement of existing modules.

Re-ranking the retrieved information to\\nrelocate the most relevant content to the edges of the prompt is\\na key strategy. This concept has been implemented in frame-\\nworks such as LlamaIndex 2, LangChain3, and HayStack [12].\\nFeeding all relevant documents directly into LLMs can lead\\nto information overload, diluting the focus on key details with\\nirrelevant content.To mitigate this, post-retrieval efforts con-\\ncentrate on selecting the essential information, emphasizing\\ncritical sections, and shortening the context to be processed.\\n2https://www.llamaindex.ai\\n3https://www.langchain.com/\\nC. Modular RAG\\nThe modular RAG architecture advances beyond the for-\\nmer two RAG paradigms, offering enhanced adaptability and\\nversatility. It incorporates diverse strategies for improving its\\ncomponents, such as adding a search module for similarity\\nsearches and refining the retriever through fine-tuning.

Routing in the RAG system\\nnavigates through diverse data sources, selecting the optimal\\npathway for a query, whether it involves summarization,\\nspecific database searches, or merging different information\\nstreams [19]. The Predict module aims to reduce redundancy\\nand noise by generating context directly through the LLM,\\nensuring relevance and accuracy [13]. Lastly, the Task Adapter\\nmodule tailors RAG to various downstream tasks, automating\\nprompt retrieval for zero-shot inputs and creating task-specific\\nretrievers through few-shot query generation [20], [21] .This\\ncomprehensive approach not only streamlines the retrieval pro-\\ncess but also significantly improves the quality and relevance\\nof the information retrieved, catering to a wide array of tasks\\nand queries with enhanced precision and flexibility.\\n2) New Patterns: Modular RAG offers remarkable adapt-\\nability by allowing module substitution or reconfiguration\\nto address specific challenges. This goes beyond the fixed\\nstructures of Naive and Advanced RAG, characterized by a\\nsimple “Retrieve” and “Read” mechanism. Moreover, Modular\\nRAG expands this flexibility by integrating new modules or\\nadjusting interaction flow among existing ones, enhancing its\\napplicability across different tasks.\\nInnovations such as the Rewrite-Retrieve-Read [7]model\\nleverage the LLM’s capabilities to refine retrieval queries\\nthrough a rewriting module and a LM-feedback mechanism\\nto update rewriting model., improving task performance.\\nSimilarly, approaches like Generate-Read [13] replace tradi-\\ntional retrieval with LLM-generated content, while Recite-\\nRead [22] emphasizes retrieval from model weights, enhanc-\\ning the model’s ability to handle knowledge-intensive tasks.\\nHybrid retrieval strategies integrate keyword, semantic, and\\nvector searches to cater to diverse queries. Additionally, em-\\nploying sub-queries and hypothetical document embeddings\\n(HyDE) [11] seeks to improve retrieval relevance by focusing\\non embedding similarities between generated answers and real\\ndocuments.\\nAdjustments in module arrangement and interaction, such\\nas the Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) [23] framework\\nand the iterative Retrieve-Read-Retrieve-Read flow of ITER-\\nRETGEN [14], showcase the dynamic use of module out-\\nputs to bolster another module’s functionality, illustrating a\\nsophisticated understanding of enhancing module synergy.\\nThe flexible orchestration of Modular RAG Flow showcases\\nthe benefits of adaptive retrieval through techniques such as\\nFLARE [24] and Self-RAG [25]. This approach transcends\\nthe fixed RAG retrieval process by evaluating the necessity\\nof retrieval based on different scenarios. Another benefit of\\na flexible architecture is that the RAG system can more\\neasily integrate with other technologies (such as fine-tuning\\nor reinforcement learning) [26]. For example, this can involve\\nfine-tuning the retriever for better retrieval results, fine-tuning\\nthe generator for more personalized outputs, or engaging in\\ncollaborative fine-tuning [27].\\nD. RAG vs Fine-tuning\\nThe augmentation of LLMs has attracted considerable atten-\\ntion due to their growing prevalence. Among the optimization\\nmethods for LLMs, RAG is often compared with Fine-tuning\\n(FT) and prompt engineering. Each method has distinct charac-\\nteristics as illustrated in Figure 4. We used a quadrant chart to\\nillustrate the differences among three methods in two dimen-\\nsions: external knowledge requirements and model adaption\\nrequirements. Prompt engineering leverages a model’s inherent\\ncapabilities with minimum necessity for external knowledge\\nand model adaption. RAG can be likened to providing a model\\nwith a tailored textbook for information retrieval, ideal for pre-\\ncise information retrieval tasks. In contrast, FT is comparable\\nto a student internalizing knowledge over time, suitable for\\nscenarios requiring replication of specific structures, styles, or\\nformats.\\nRAG excels in dynamic environments by offering real-\\ntime knowledge updates and effective utilization of external\\nknowledge sources with high interpretability. However, it\\ncomes with higher latency and ethical considerations regarding\\ndata retrieval. On the other hand, FT is more static, requiring\\nretraining for updates but enabling deep customization of the\\nmodel’s behavior and style. It demands significant compu-\\ntational resources for dataset preparation and training, and\\nwhile it can reduce hallucinations, it may face challenges with\\nunfamiliar data.\\nIn multiple evaluations of their performance on various\\nknowledge-intensive tasks across different topics, [28] re-\\nvealed that while unsupervised fine-tuning shows some im-\\nprovement, RAG consistently outperforms it, for both exist-\\ning knowledge encountered during training and entirely new\\nknowledge. Additionally, it was found that LLMs struggle\\nto learn new factual information through unsupervised fine-\\ntuning. The choice between RAG and FT depends on the\\nspecific needs for data dynamics, customization, and com-\\nputational capabilities in the application context. RAG and\\nFT are not mutually exclusive and can complement each\\nother, enhancing a model’s capabilities at different levels.\\nIn some instances, their combined use may lead to optimal\\nperformance. The optimization process involving RAG and FT\\nmay require multiple iterations to achieve satisfactory results.\\nIII. R ETRIEVAL\\nIn the context of RAG, it is crucial to efficiently retrieve\\nrelevant documents from the data source. There are several\\nkey issues involved, such as the retrieval source, retrieval\\ngranularity, pre-processing of the retrieval, and selection of\\nthe corresponding embedding model.\\nA. Retrieval Source\\nRAG relies on external knowledge to enhance LLMs, while\\nthe type of retrieval source and the granularity of retrieval\\nunits both affect the final generation results.\\n1) Data Structure: Initially, text is s the mainstream source\\nof retrieval. Subsequently, the retrieval source expanded to in-\\nclude semi-structured data (PDF) and structured data (Knowl-\\nedge Graph, KG) for enhancement. In addition to retrieving\\nfrom original external sources, there is also a growing trend in\\nrecent researches towards utilizing content generated by LLMs\\nthemselves for retrieval and enhancement purposes.'),\n",

RAG compared with other model optimization methods in the aspects of “External Knowledge Required” and “Model Adaption Required”. Prompt\\nEngineering requires low modifications to the model and external knowledge, focusing on harnessing the capabilities of LLMs themselves. Fine-tuning, on\\nthe other hand, involves further training the model. In the early stages of RAG (Naive RAG), there is a low demand for model modifications. As research\\nprogresses, Modular RAG has become more integrated with fine-tuning techniques.\\nUnstructured Data , such as text, is the most widely used\\nretrieval source, which are mainly gathered from corpus. For\\nopen-domain question-answering (ODQA) tasks, the primary\\nretrieval sources are Wikipedia Dump with the current major\\nversions including HotpotQA 4 (1st October , 2017), DPR5 (20\\nDecember, 2018). In addition to encyclopedic data, common\\nunstructured data includes cross-lingual text [19] and domain-\\nspecific data (such as medical [67]and legal domains [29]).\\nSemi-structured data. typically refers to data that contains a\\ncombination of text and table information, such as PDF. Han-\\ndling semi-structured data poses challenges for conventional\\nRAG systems due to two main reasons. Firstly, text splitting\\nprocesses may inadvertently separate tables, leading to data\\ncorruption during retrieval. Secondly, incorporating tables into\\nthe data can complicate semantic similarity searches. When\\ndealing with semi-structured data, one approach involves lever-\\naging the code capabilities of LLMs to execute Text-2-SQL\\nqueries on tables within databases, such as TableGPT [85].\\nAlternatively, tables can be transformed into text format for\\nfurther analysis using text-based methods [75]. However, both\\nof these methods are not optimal solutions, indicating substan-\\ntial research opportunities in this area.\\nStructured data , such as knowledge graphs (KGs) [86] ,\\nwhich are typically verified and can provide more precise in-\\nformation. KnowledGPT [15] generates KB search queries and\\nstores knowledge in a personalized base, enhancing the RAG\\nmodel’s knowledge richness. In response to the limitations of\\nLLMs in understanding and answering questions about textual\\ngraphs, G-Retriever [84] integrates Graph Neural Networks\\n4https://hotpotqa.github.io/wiki-readme.html\\n5https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR\\n(GNNs), LLMs and RAG, enhancing graph comprehension\\nand question-answering capabilities through soft prompting\\nof the LLM, and employs the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree\\n(PCST) optimization problem for targeted graph retrieval. On\\nthe contrary, it requires additional effort to build, validate,\\nand maintain structured databases. On the contrary, it requires\\nadditional effort to build, validate, and maintain structured\\ndatabases.\\nLLMs-Generated Content. Addressing the limitations of\\nexternal auxiliary information in RAG, some research has\\nfocused on exploiting LLMs’ internal knowledge. SKR [58]\\nclassifies questions as known or unknown, applying retrieval\\nenhancement selectively. GenRead [13] replaces the retriever\\nwith an LLM generator, finding that LLM-generated contexts\\noften contain more accurate answers due to better alignment\\nwith the pre-training objectives of causal language modeling.\\nSelfmem [17] iteratively creates an unbounded memory pool\\nwith a retrieval-enhanced generator, using a memory selec-\\ntor to choose outputs that serve as dual problems to the\\noriginal question, thus self-enhancing the generative model.\\nThese methodologies underscore the breadth of innovative\\ndata source utilization in RAG, striving to improve model\\nperformance and task effectiveness.\\n2) Retrieval Granularity: Another important factor besides\\nthe data format of the retrieval source is the granularity of\\nthe retrieved data. Coarse-grained retrieval units theoretically\\ncan provide more relevant information for the problem, but\\nthey may also contain redundant content, which could distract\\nthe retriever and language models in downstream tasks [50],\\n[87]. On the other hand, fine-grained retrieval unit granularity\\nincreases the burden of retrieval and does not guarantee seman-\\ntic integrity and meeting the required knowledge. Choosing'),\n",

Among them, DenseX [30]proposed the concept of\\nusing propositions as retrieval units. Propositions are defined\\nas atomic expressions in the text, each encapsulating a unique\\nfactual segment and presented in a concise, self-contained nat-\\nural language format. This approach aims to enhance retrieval\\nprecision and relevance. On the Knowledge Graph (KG),\\nretrieval granularity includes Entity, Triplet, and sub-Graph.\\nThe granularity of retrieval can also be adapted to downstream\\ntasks, such as retrieving Item IDs [40]in recommendation tasks\\nand Sentence pairs [38]. Detailed information is illustrated in\\nTable I.\\nB. Indexing Optimization\\nIn the Indexing phase, documents will be processed, seg-\\nmented, and transformed into Embeddings to be stored in a\\nvector database. The quality of index construction determines\\nwhether the correct context can be obtained in the retrieval\\nphase.\\n1) Chunking Strategy: The most common method is to split\\nthe document into chunks on a fixed number of tokens (e.g.,\\n100, 256, 512) [88]. Larger chunks can capture more context,\\nbut they also generate more noise, requiring longer processing\\ntime and higher costs. While smaller chunks may not fully\\nconvey the necessary context, they do have less noise. How-\\never, chunks leads to truncation within sentences, prompting\\nthe optimization of a recursive splits and sliding window meth-\\nods, enabling layered retrieval by merging globally related\\ninformation across multiple retrieval processes [89]. Never-\\ntheless, these approaches still cannot strike a balance between\\nsemantic completeness and context length. Therefore, methods\\nlike Small2Big have been proposed, where sentences (small)\\nare used as the retrieval unit, and the preceding and following\\nsentences are provided as (big) context to LLMs [90].\\n2) Metadata Attachments: Chunks can be enriched with\\nmetadata information such as page number, file name, au-\\nthor,category timestamp. Subsequently, retrieval can be filtered\\nbased on this metadata, limiting the scope of the retrieval.\\nAssigning different weights to document timestamps during\\nretrieval can achieve time-aware RAG, ensuring the freshness\\nof knowledge and avoiding outdated information.\\nIn addition to extracting metadata from the original doc-\\numents, metadata can also be artificially constructed. For\\nexample, adding summaries of paragraph, as well as intro-\\nducing hypothetical questions. This method is also known as\\nReverse HyDE. Specifically, using LLM to generate questions\\nthat can be answered by the document, then calculating the\\nsimilarity between the original question and the hypothetical\\nquestion during retrieval to reduce the semantic gap between\\nthe question and the answer.\\n3) Structural Index: One effective method for enhancing\\ninformation retrieval is to establish a hierarchical structure for\\nthe documents. By constructing In structure, RAG system can\\nexpedite the retrieval and processing of pertinent data.\\nHierarchical index structure . File are arranged in parent-\\nchild relationships, with chunks linked to them. Data sum-\\nmaries are stored at each node, aiding in the swift traversal\\nof data and assisting the RAG system in determining which\\nchunks to extract. This approach can also mitigate the illusion\\ncaused by block extraction issues.\\nKnowledge Graph index . Utilize KG in constructing the\\nhierarchical structure of documents contributes to maintaining\\nconsistency. It delineates the connections between different\\nconcepts and entities, markedly reducing the potential for\\nillusions. Another advantage is the transformation of the\\ninformation retrieval process into instructions that LLM can\\ncomprehend, thereby enhancing the accuracy of knowledge\\nretrieval and enabling LLM to generate contextually coherent\\nresponses, thus improving the overall efficiency of the RAG\\nsystem. To capture the logical relationship between document\\ncontent and structure, KGP [91] proposed a method of building\\nan index between multiple documents using KG. This KG\\nconsists of nodes (representing paragraphs or structures in the\\ndocuments, such as pages and tables) and edges (indicating\\nsemantic/lexical similarity between paragraphs or relationships\\nwithin the document structure), effectively addressing knowl-\\nedge retrieval and reasoning problems in a multi-document\\nenvironment.\\nC. Query Optimization\\nOne of the primary challenges with Naive RAG is its\\ndirect reliance on the user’s original query as the basis for\\nretrieval. Formulating a precise and clear question is difficult,\\nand imprudent queries result in subpar retrieval effectiveness.\\nSometimes, the question itself is complex, and the language\\nis not well-organized. Another difficulty lies in language\\ncomplexity ambiguity. Language models often struggle when\\ndealing with specialized vocabulary or ambiguous abbrevi-\\nations with multiple meanings. For instance, they may not\\ndiscern whether “LLM” refers to large language model or a\\nMaster of Laws in a legal context.\\n1) Query Expansion: Expanding a single query into mul-\\ntiple queries enriches the content of the query, providing\\nfurther context to address any lack of specific nuances, thereby\\nensuring the optimal relevance of the generated answers.\\nMulti-Query. By employing prompt engineering to expand\\nqueries via LLMs, these queries can then be executed in\\nparallel. The expansion of queries is not random, but rather\\nmeticulously designed.\\nSub-Query. The process of sub-question planning represents\\nthe generation of the necessary sub-questions to contextualize\\nand fully answer the original question when combined. This\\nprocess of adding relevant context is, in principle, similar\\nto query expansion. Specifically, a complex question can be\\ndecomposed into a series of simpler sub-questions using the\\nleast-to-most prompting method [92].\\nChain-of-Verification(CoVe). The expanded queries undergo\\nvalidation by LLM to achieve the effect of reducing halluci-\\nnations. Validated expanded queries typically exhibit higher\\nreliability [93].'),\n",

There-\\nfore, we can prompt LLM to rewrite the queries. In addition to\\nusing LLM for query rewriting, specialized smaller language\\nmodels, such as RRR (Rewrite-retrieve-read) [7]. The imple-\\nmentation of the query rewrite method in the Taobao, known\\nas BEQUE [9] has notably enhanced recall effectiveness for\\nlong-tail queries, resulting in a rise in GMV .\\nAnother query transformation method is to use prompt\\nengineering to let LLM generate a query based on the original\\nquery for subsequent retrieval. HyDE [11] construct hypothet-\\nical documents (assumed answers to the original query). It\\nfocuses on embedding similarity from answer to answer rather\\nthan seeking embedding similarity for the problem or query.\\nUsing the Step-back Prompting method [10], the original\\nquery is abstracted to generate a high-level concept question\\n(step-back question). In the RAG system, both the step-back\\nquestion and the original query are used for retrieval, and both\\nthe results are utilized as the basis for language model answer\\ngeneration.\\n3) Query Routing: Based on varying queries, routing to\\ndistinct RAG pipeline,which is suitable for a versatile RAG\\nsystem designed to accommodate diverse scenarios.\\nMetadata Router/ Filter . The first step involves extracting\\nkeywords (entity) from the query, followed by filtering based\\non the keywords and metadata within the chunks to narrow\\ndown the search scope.\\nSemantic Router is another method of routing involves\\nleveraging the semantic information of the query. Specific\\napprach see Semantic Router 6. Certainly, a hybrid routing\\napproach can also be employed, combining both semantic and\\nmetadata-based methods for enhanced query routing.\\nD. Embedding\\nIn RAG, retrieval is achieved by calculating the similarity\\n(e.g. cosine similarity) between the embeddings of the ques-\\ntion and document chunks, where the semantic representation\\ncapability of embedding models plays a key role. This mainly\\nincludes a sparse encoder (BM25) and a dense retriever (BERT\\narchitecture Pre-training language models). Recent research\\nhas introduced prominent embedding models such as AngIE,\\nV oyage, BGE,etc [94]–[96], which are benefit from multi-task\\ninstruct tuning. Hugging Face’s MTEB leaderboard 7 evaluates\\nembedding models across 8 tasks, covering 58 datasests. Ad-\\nditionally, C-MTEB focuses on Chinese capability, covering\\n6 tasks and 35 datasets. There is no one-size-fits-all answer\\nto “which embedding model to use.” However, some specific\\nmodels are better suited for particular use cases.\\n1) Mix/hybrid Retrieval : Sparse and dense embedding\\napproaches capture different relevance features and can ben-\\nefit from each other by leveraging complementary relevance\\ninformation. For instance, sparse retrieval models can be used\\n6https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router\\n7https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard\\nto provide initial search results for training dense retrieval\\nmodels. Additionally, pre-training language models (PLMs)\\ncan be utilized to learn term weights to enhance sparse\\nretrieval. Specifically, it also demonstrates that sparse retrieval\\nmodels can enhance the zero-shot retrieval capability of dense\\nretrieval models and assist dense retrievers in handling queries\\ncontaining rare entities, thereby improving robustness.\\n2) Fine-tuning Embedding Model: In instances where the\\ncontext significantly deviates from pre-training corpus, partic-\\nularly within highly specialized disciplines such as healthcare,\\nlegal practice, and other sectors replete with proprietary jargon,\\nfine-tuning the embedding model on your own domain dataset\\nbecomes essential to mitigate such discrepancies.\\nIn addition to supplementing domain knowledge, another\\npurpose of fine-tuning is to align the retriever and generator,\\nfor example, using the results of LLM as the supervision signal\\nfor fine-tuning, known as LSR (LM-supervised Retriever).\\nPROMPTAGATOR [21] utilizes the LLM as a few-shot query\\ngenerator to create task-specific retrievers, addressing chal-\\nlenges in supervised fine-tuning, particularly in data-scarce\\ndomains. Another approach, LLM-Embedder [97], exploits\\nLLMs to generate reward signals across multiple downstream\\ntasks. The retriever is fine-tuned with two types of supervised\\nsignals: hard labels for the dataset and soft rewards from\\nthe LLMs. This dual-signal approach fosters a more effective\\nfine-tuning process, tailoring the embedding model to diverse\\ndownstream applications. REPLUG [72] utilizes a retriever\\nand an LLM to calculate the probability distributions of the\\nretrieved documents and then performs supervised training\\nby computing the KL divergence. This straightforward and\\neffective training method enhances the performance of the\\nretrieval model by using an LM as the supervisory signal,\\neliminating the need for specific cross-attention mechanisms.\\nMoreover, inspired by RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from\\nHuman Feedback), utilizing LM-based feedback to reinforce\\nthe retriever through reinforcement learning.\\nE. Adapter\\nFine-tuning models may present challenges, such as in-\\ntegrating functionality through an API or addressing con-\\nstraints arising from limited local computational resources.\\nConsequently, some approaches opt to incorporate an external\\nadapter to aid in alignment.\\nTo optimize the multi-task capabilities of LLM, UP-\\nRISE [20] trained a lightweight prompt retriever that can\\nautomatically retrieve prompts from a pre-built prompt pool\\nthat are suitable for a given zero-shot task input. AAR\\n(Augmentation-Adapted Retriver) [47] introduces a universal\\nadapter designed to accommodate multiple downstream tasks.\\nWhile PRCA [69] add a pluggable reward-driven contextual\\nadapter to enhance performance on specific tasks. BGM [26]\\nkeeps the retriever and LLM fixed,and trains a bridge Seq2Seq\\nmodel in between. The bridge model aims to transform the\\nretrieved information into a format that LLMs can work with\\neffectively, allowing it to not only rerank but also dynami-\\ncally select passages for each query, and potentially employ\\nmore advanced strategies like repetition.

In this\\napproach, the retriever module is directly substituted to gen-\\nerate relevant documents according to a query. This method\\nassists in addressing the difficulties encountered during the\\nfine-tuning process and enhances model performance.\\nIV. G ENERATION\\nAfter retrieval, it is not a good practice to directly input all\\nthe retrieved information to the LLM for answering questions.\\nFollowing will introduce adjustments from two perspectives:\\nadjusting the retrieved content and adjusting the LLM.\\nA. Context Curation\\nRedundant information can interfere with the final gener-\\nation of LLM, and overly long contexts can also lead LLM\\nto the “Lost in the middle” problem [98]. Like humans, LLM\\ntends to only focus on the beginning and end of long texts,\\nwhile forgetting the middle portion. Therefore, in the RAG\\nsystem, we typically need to further process the retrieved\\ncontent.\\n1) Reranking: Reranking fundamentally reorders document\\nchunks to highlight the most pertinent results first, effectively\\nreducing the overall document pool, severing a dual purpose\\nin information retrieval, acting as both an enhancer and a\\nfilter, delivering refined inputs for more precise language\\nmodel processing [70]. Reranking can be performed using\\nrule-based methods that depend on predefined metrics like\\nDiversity, Relevance, and MRR, or model-based approaches\\nlike Encoder-Decoder models from the BERT series (e.g.,\\nSpanBERT), specialized reranking models such as Cohere\\nrerank or bge-raranker-large, and general large language mod-\\nels like GPT [12], [99].\\n2) Context Selection/Compression: A common misconcep-\\ntion in the RAG process is the belief that retrieving as many\\nrelevant documents as possible and concatenating them to form\\na lengthy retrieval prompt is beneficial. However, excessive\\ncontext can introduce more noise, diminishing the LLM’s\\nperception of key information .\\n(Long) LLMLingua [100], [101] utilize small language\\nmodels (SLMs) such as GPT-2 Small or LLaMA-7B, to\\ndetect and remove unimportant tokens, transforming it into\\na form that is challenging for humans to comprehend but\\nwell understood by LLMs. This approach presents a direct\\nand practical method for prompt compression, eliminating the\\nneed for additional training of LLMs while balancing language\\nintegrity and compression ratio. PRCA tackled this issue by\\ntraining an information extractor [69]. Similarly, RECOMP\\nadopts a comparable approach by training an information\\ncondenser using contrastive learning [71]. Each training data\\npoint consists of one positive sample and five negative sam-\\nples, and the encoder undergoes training using contrastive loss\\nthroughout this process [102] .\\nIn addition to compressing the context, reducing the num-\\nber of documents aslo helps improve the accuracy of the\\nmodel’s answers. Ma et al. [103] propose the “Filter-Reranker”\\nparadigm, which combines the strengths of LLMs and SLMs.\\nIn this paradigm, SLMs serve as filters, while LLMs function\\nas reordering agents. The research shows that instructing\\nLLMs to rearrange challenging samples identified by SLMs\\nleads to significant improvements in various Information\\nExtraction (IE) tasks. Another straightforward and effective\\napproach involves having the LLM evaluate the retrieved\\ncontent before generating the final answer. This allows the\\nLLM to filter out documents with poor relevance through LLM\\ncritique. For instance, in Chatlaw [104], the LLM is prompted\\nto self-suggestion on the referenced legal provisions to assess\\ntheir relevance.\\nB. LLM Fine-tuning\\nTargeted fine-tuning based on the scenario and data char-\\nacteristics on LLMs can yield better results. This is also one\\nof the greatest advantages of using on-premise LLMs. When\\nLLMs lack data in a specific domain, additional knowledge can\\nbe provided to the LLM through fine-tuning. Huggingface’s\\nfine-tuning data can also be used as an initial step.\\nAnother benefit of fine-tuning is the ability to adjust the\\nmodel’s input and output. For example, it can enable LLM to\\nadapt to specific data formats and generate responses in a par-\\nticular style as instructed [37]. For retrieval tasks that engage\\nwith structured data, the SANTA framework [76] implements\\na tripartite training regimen to effectively encapsulate both\\nstructural and semantic nuances. The initial phase focuses on\\nthe retriever, where contrastive learning is harnessed to refine\\nthe query and document embeddings.\\nAligning LLM outputs with human or retriever preferences\\nthrough reinforcement learning is a potential approach. For\\ninstance, manually annotating the final generated answers\\nand then providing feedback through reinforcement learning.\\nIn addition to aligning with human preferences, it is also\\npossible to align with the preferences of fine-tuned models\\nand retrievers [79]. When circumstances prevent access to\\npowerful proprietary models or larger parameter open-source\\nmodels, a simple and effective method is to distill the more\\npowerful models(e.g. GPT-4). Fine-tuning of LLM can also\\nbe coordinated with fine-tuning of the retriever to align pref-\\nerences. A typical approach, such as RA-DIT [27], aligns the\\nscoring functions between Retriever and Generator using KL\\ndivergence.\\nV. A UGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG\\nIn the domain of RAG, the standard practice often involves\\na singular (once) retrieval step followed by generation, which\\ncan lead to inefficiencies and sometimes is typically insuffi-\\ncient for complex problems demanding multi-step reasoning,\\nas it provides a limited scope of information [105]. Many\\nstudies have optimized the retrieval process in response to this\\nissue, and we have summarised them in Figure 5.\\nA.

In addition to the most common once retrieval, RAG also includes three types of retrieval augmentation processes. (left) Iterative retrieval involves\\nalternating between retrieval and generation, allowing for richer and more targeted context from the knowledge base at each step. (Middle) Recursive retrieval\\ninvolves gradually refining the user query and breaking down the problem into sub-problems, then continuously solving complex problems through retrieval\\nand generation. (Right) Adaptive retrieval focuses on enabling the RAG system to autonomously determine whether external knowledge retrieval is necessary\\nand when to stop retrieval and generation, often utilizing LLM-generated special tokens for control.\\nbase for LLMs. This approach has been shown to enhance\\nthe robustness of subsequent answer generation by offering\\nadditional contextual references through multiple retrieval\\niterations. However, it may be affected by semantic discon-\\ntinuity and the accumulation of irrelevant information. ITER-\\nRETGEN [14] employs a synergistic approach that lever-\\nages “retrieval-enhanced generation” alongside “generation-\\nenhanced retrieval” for tasks that necessitate the reproduction\\nof specific information. The model harnesses the content\\nrequired to address the input task as a contextual basis for\\nretrieving pertinent knowledge, which in turn facilitates the\\ngeneration of improved responses in subsequent iterations.\\nB. Recursive Retrieval\\nRecursive retrieval is often used in information retrieval and\\nNLP to improve the depth and relevance of search results.\\nThe process involves iteratively refining search queries based\\non the results obtained from previous searches. Recursive\\nRetrieval aims to enhance the search experience by gradu-\\nally converging on the most pertinent information through a\\nfeedback loop. IRCoT [61] uses chain-of-thought to guide\\nthe retrieval process and refines the CoT with the obtained\\nretrieval results. ToC [57] creates a clarification tree that\\nsystematically optimizes the ambiguous parts in the Query. It\\ncan be particularly useful in complex search scenarios where\\nthe user’s needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where\\nthe information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. The\\nrecursive nature of the process allows for continuous learning\\nand adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in\\nimproved satisfaction with the search outcomes.\\nTo address specific data scenarios, recursive retrieval and\\nmulti-hop retrieval techniques are utilized together. Recursive\\nretrieval involves a structured index to process and retrieve\\ndata in a hierarchical manner, which may include summarizing\\nsections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a\\nretrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary\\nretrieval within the document refines the search, embodying\\nthe recursive nature of the process. In contrast, multi-hop\\nretrieval is designed to delve deeper into graph-structured data\\nsources, extracting interconnected information [106].\\nC. Adaptive Retrieval\\nAdaptive retrieval methods, exemplified by Flare [24] and\\nSelf-RAG [25], refine the RAG framework by enabling LLMs\\nto actively determine the optimal moments and content for\\nretrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the\\ninformation sourced.\\nThese methods are part of a broader trend wherein\\nLLMs employ active judgment in their operations, as seen\\nin model agents like AutoGPT, Toolformer, and Graph-\\nToolformer [107]–[109]. Graph-Toolformer, for instance, di-\\nvides its retrieval process into distinct steps where LLMs\\nproactively use retrievers, apply Self-Ask techniques, and em-\\nploy few-shot prompts to initiate search queries. This proactive\\nstance allows LLMs to decide when to search for necessary\\ninformation, akin to how an agent utilizes tools.\\nWebGPT [110] integrates a reinforcement learning frame-\\nwork to train the GPT-3 model in autonomously using a\\nsearch engine during text generation. It navigates this process\\nusing special tokens that facilitate actions such as search\\nengine queries, browsing results, and citing references, thereby\\nexpanding GPT-3’s capabilities through the use of external\\nsearch engines.

T ASK AND EVALUATION\\nThe rapid advancement and growing adoption of RAG\\nin the field of NLP have propelled the evaluation of RAG\\nmodels to the forefront of research in the LLMs community.\\nThe primary objective of this evaluation is to comprehend\\nand optimize the performance of RAG models across diverse\\napplication scenarios.This chapter will mainly introduce the\\nmain downstream tasks of RAG, datasets, and how to evaluate\\nRAG systems.\\nA. Downstream Task\\nThe core task of RAG remains Question Answering (QA),\\nincluding traditional single-hop/multi-hop QA, multiple-\\nchoice, domain-specific QA as well as long-form scenarios\\nsuitable for RAG. In addition to QA, RAG is continuously\\nbeing expanded into multiple downstream tasks, such as Infor-\\nmation Extraction (IE), dialogue generation, code search, etc.\\nThe main downstream tasks of RAG and their corresponding\\ndatasets are summarized in Table II.\\nB. Evaluation Target\\nHistorically, RAG models assessments have centered on\\ntheir execution in specific downstream tasks. These evaluations\\nemploy established metrics suitable to the tasks at hand. For\\ninstance, question answering evaluations might rely on EM\\nand F1 scores [7], [45], [59], [72], whereas fact-checking\\ntasks often hinge on Accuracy as the primary metric [4],\\n[14], [42]. BLEU and ROUGE metrics are also commonly\\nused to evaluate answer quality [26], [32], [52], [78]. Tools\\nlike RALLE, designed for the automatic evaluation of RAG\\napplications, similarly base their assessments on these task-\\nspecific metrics [160]. Despite this, there is a notable paucity\\nof research dedicated to evaluating the distinct characteristics\\nof RAG models.The main evaluation objectives include:\\nRetrieval Quality. Evaluating the retrieval quality is crucial\\nfor determining the effectiveness of the context sourced by\\nthe retriever component. Standard metrics from the domains\\nof search engines, recommendation systems, and information\\nretrieval systems are employed to measure the performance of\\nthe RAG retrieval module. Metrics such as Hit Rate, MRR, and\\nNDCG are commonly utilized for this purpose [161], [162].\\nGeneration Quality . The assessment of generation quality\\ncenters on the generator’s capacity to synthesize coherent and\\nrelevant answers from the retrieved context. This evaluation\\ncan be categorized based on the content’s objectives: unlabeled\\nand labeled content. For unlabeled content, the evaluation\\nencompasses the faithfulness, relevance, and non-harmfulness\\nof the generated answers. In contrast, for labeled content,\\nthe focus is on the accuracy of the information produced by\\nthe model [161]. Additionally, both retrieval and generation\\nquality assessments can be conducted through manual or\\nautomatic evaluation methods [29], [161], [163].\\nC. Evaluation Aspects\\nContemporary evaluation practices of RAG models empha-\\nsize three primary quality scores and four essential abilities,\\nwhich collectively inform the evaluation of the two principal\\ntargets of the RAG model: retrieval and generation.\\n1) Quality Scores: Quality scores include context rele-\\nvance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance.

It is essential to recognize that these\\nmetrics, derived from related work, are traditional measures\\nand do not yet represent a mature or standardized approach for\\nquantifying RAG evaluation aspects. Custom metrics tailored\\nto the nuances of RAG models, though not included here, have\\nalso been developed in some evaluation studies.\\nD. Evaluation Benchmarks and Tools\\nA series of benchmark tests and tools have been proposed\\nto facilitate the evaluation of RAG.These instruments furnish\\nquantitative metrics that not only gauge RAG model perfor-\\nmance but also enhance comprehension of the model’s capabil-\\nities across various evaluation aspects. Prominent benchmarks\\nsuch as RGB, RECALL and CRUD [167]–[169] focus on\\nappraising the essential abilities of RAG models. Concur-\\nrently, state-of-the-art automated tools like RAGAS [164],\\nARES [165], and TruLens 8 employ LLMs to adjudicate the\\nquality scores. These tools and benchmarks collectively form\\na robust framework for the systematic evaluation of RAG\\nmodels, as summarized in Table IV.\\nVII. D ISCUSSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS\\nDespite the considerable progress in RAG technology, sev-\\neral challenges persist that warrant in-depth research.This\\nchapter will mainly introduce the current challenges and future\\nresearch directions faced by RAG.\\nA. RAG vs Long Context\\nWith the deepening of related research, the context of LLMs\\nis continuously expanding [170]–[172]. Presently, LLMs can\\neffortlessly manage contexts exceeding 200,000 tokens 9. This\\ncapability signifies that long-document question answering,\\npreviously reliant on RAG, can now incorporate the entire\\ndocument directly into the prompt. This has also sparked\\ndiscussions on whether RAG is still necessary when LLMs\\n8https://www.trulens.org/trulens eval/core concepts rag triad/\\n9https://kimi.moonshot.cn\\nare not constrained by context. In fact, RAG still plays an\\nirreplaceable role. On one hand, providing LLMs with a\\nlarge amount of context at once will significantly impact its\\ninference speed, while chunked retrieval and on-demand input\\ncan significantly improve operational efficiency. On the other\\nhand, RAG-based generation can quickly locate the original\\nreferences for LLMs to help users verify the generated an-\\nswers. The entire retrieval and reasoning process is observable,\\nwhile generation solely relying on long context remains a\\nblack box. Conversely, the expansion of context provides new\\nopportunities for the development of RAG, enabling it to\\naddress more complex problems and integrative or summary\\nquestions that require reading a large amount of material to\\nanswer [49]. Developing new RAG methods in the context of\\nsuper-long contexts is one of the future research trends.\\nB. RAG Robustness\\nThe presence of noise or contradictory information during\\nretrieval can detrimentally affect RAG’s output quality. This\\nsituation is figuratively referred to as “Misinformation can\\nbe worse than no information at all”. Improving RAG’s\\nresistance to such adversarial or counterfactual inputs is gain-\\ning research momentum and has become a key performance\\nmetric [48], [50], [82]. Cuconasu et al. [54] analyze which\\ntype of documents should be retrieved, evaluate the relevance\\nof the documents to the prompt, their position, and the\\nnumber included in the context. The research findings reveal\\nthat including irrelevant documents can unexpectedly increase\\naccuracy by over 30%, contradicting the initial assumption\\nof reduced quality. These results underscore the importance\\nof developing specialized strategies to integrate retrieval with\\nlanguage generation models, highlighting the need for further\\nresearch and exploration into the robustness of RAG.\\nC. Hybrid Approaches\\nCombining RAG with fine-tuning is emerging as a leading\\nstrategy.

Readers are encouraged to consult pertinent literature for the specific quantification formulas associated with these\\nmetrics, as required.\\nand non-parameterized advantages are areas ripe for explo-\\nration [27]. Another trend is to introduce SLMs with specific\\nfunctionalities into RAG and fine-tuned by the results of RAG\\nsystem. For example, CRAG [67] trains a lightweight retrieval\\nevaluator to assess the overall quality of the retrieved docu-\\nments for a query and triggers different knowledge retrieval\\nactions based on confidence levels.\\nD. Scaling laws of RAG\\nEnd-to-end RAG models and pre-trained models based\\non RAG are still one of the focuses of current re-\\nsearchers [173].The parameters of these models are one of\\nthe key factors.While scaling laws [174] are established for\\nLLMs, their applicability to RAG remains uncertain. Initial\\nstudies like RETRO++ [44] have begun to address this, yet the\\nparameter count in RAG models still lags behind that of LLMs.\\nThe possibility of an Inverse Scaling Law 10, where smaller\\nmodels outperform larger ones, is particularly intriguing and\\nmerits further investigation.\\nE. Production-Ready RAG\\nRAG’s practicality and alignment with engineering require-\\nments have facilitated its adoption. However, enhancing re-\\ntrieval efficiency, improving document recall in large knowl-\\nedge bases, and ensuring data security—such as preventing\\n10https://github.com/inverse-scaling/prize\\ninadvertent disclosure of document sources or metadata by\\nLLMs—are critical engineering challenges that remain to be\\naddressed [175].\\nThe development of the RAG ecosystem is greatly impacted\\nby the progression of its technical stack. Key tools like\\nLangChain and LLamaIndex have quickly gained popularity\\nwith the emergence of ChatGPT, providing extensive RAG-\\nrelated APIs and becoming essential in the realm of LLMs.The\\nemerging technology stack, while not as rich in features as\\nLangChain and LLamaIndex, stands out through its specialized\\nproducts. For example, Flowise AI prioritizes a low-code\\napproach, allowing users to deploy AI applications, including\\nRAG, through a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. Other\\ntechnologies like HayStack, Meltano, and Cohere Coral are\\nalso gaining attention for their unique contributions to the field.\\nIn addition to AI-focused vendors, traditional software and\\ncloud service providers are expanding their offerings to include\\nRAG-centric services. Weaviate’s Verba 11 is designed for\\npersonal assistant applications, while Amazon’s Kendra 12\\noffers intelligent enterprise search services, enabling users to\\nbrowse various content repositories using built-in connectors.\\nIn the development of RAG technology, there is a clear\\ntrend towards different specialization directions, such as: 1)\\nCustomization - tailoring RAG to meet specific requirements.\\n2) Simplification - making RAG easier to use to reduce the\\n11https://github.com/weaviate/Verba\\n12https://aws.amazon.com/cn/kendra/'),\n",

Multi-modal RAG\\nRAG has transcended its initial text-based question-\\nanswering confines, embracing a diverse array of modal data.\\nThis expansion has spawned innovative multimodal models\\nthat integrate RAG concepts across various domains:\\nImage. RA-CM3 [176] stands as a pioneering multimodal\\nmodel of both retrieving and generating text and images.\\nBLIP-2 [177] leverages frozen image encoders alongside\\nLLMs for efficient visual language pre-training, enabling zero-\\nshot image-to-text conversions. The “Visualize Before You\\nWrite” method [178] employs image generation to steer the\\nLM’s text generation, showing promise in open-ended text\\ngeneration tasks.\\nAudio and Video . The GSS method retrieves and stitches\\ntogether audio clips to convert machine-translated data into\\nspeech-translated data [179]. UEOP marks a significant ad-\\nvancement in end-to-end automatic speech recognition by\\nincorporating external, offline strategies for voice-to-text con-\\nversion [180]. Additionally, KNN-based attention fusion lever-\\nages audio embeddings and semantically related text embed-\\ndings to refine ASR, thereby accelerating domain adaptation.\\nVid2Seq augments language models with specialized temporal\\nmarkers, facilitating the prediction of event boundaries and\\ntextual descriptions within a unified output sequence [181].\\nCode. RBPS [182] excels in small-scale learning tasks by\\nretrieving code examples that align with developers’ objectives\\nthrough encoding and frequency analysis. This approach has\\ndemonstrated efficacy in tasks such as test assertion genera-\\ntion and program repair. For structured knowledge, the CoK\\nmethod [106] first extracts facts pertinent to the input query\\nfrom a knowledge graph, then integrates these facts as hints\\nwithin the input, enhancing performance in knowledge graph\\nquestion-answering tasks.\\nVIII. C ONCLUSION\\nThe summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 6, empha-\\nsizes RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the capa-\\nbilities of LLMs by integrating parameterized knowledge from\\nlanguage models with extensive non-parameterized data from\\nexternal knowledge bases. The survey showcases the evolution\\nof RAG technologies and their application on many different\\ntasks. The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms\\nwithin the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modu-\\nlar RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over\\nits predecessors. RAG’s technical integration with other AI\\nmethodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning,\\nhas further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in\\nRAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve\\nits robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts.\\nRAG’s application scope is expanding into multimodal do-\\nmains, adapting its principles to interpret and process diverse\\ndata forms like images, videos, and code. This expansion high-\\nlights RAG’s significant practical implications for AI deploy-\\nment, attracting interest from academic and industrial sectors.'),\n",

We used a quadrant chart to\\nillustrate the differences among three methods in two dimen-\\nsions: external knowledge requirements and model adaption\\nrequirements. Prompt engineering leverages a model’s inherent\\ncapabilities with minimum necessity for external knowledge\\nand model adaption. RAG can be likened to providing a model\\nwith a tailored textbook for information retrieval, ideal for pre-\\ncise information retrieval tasks. In contrast, FT is comparable\\nto a student internalizing knowledge over time, suitable for\\nscenarios requiring replication of specific structures, styles, or\\nformats.\\nRAG excels in dynamic environments by offering real-'),\n",
